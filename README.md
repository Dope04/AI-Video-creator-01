## Getting Started

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- If you have a separate backend, run it alongside the client and set API URLs in an `.env` file.

## Project Structure (client/src)

- `assets/` — image imports, dummy data, and `schema.prisma` (if used).
- `components/` — reusable UI pieces: `Navbar`, `Hero`, `UploadZone`, `Buttons`, `Footer`, etc.
- `pages/` — top-level pages: `Home`, `Generator`, `MyGeneration`, `Result`, `Plans`, `Community`.
- `types/` — shared TypeScript types.

## Scripts (client)

- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — build production bundle
- `npm run preview` — preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint

Check `client/package.json` for exact script names and versions.
